Monday - 
#1: 
Observational Study - Using an observational study they could have someone observe consumers in the store as they check out with the mobile pay solutions at multiple locations. They could then compare these observations with the experiences that consumers have who aren't using the mobile pay options. 
Focus Groups - Starbucks could hold a focus group with consumers who use the mobile pay solutions and ask them questions about their experience using the system compared to before when they used cash or card. They could also hold a focus group with employees and ask them questions about their interaction with customers who use mobile pay and if it has caused a positive impact on their work.
Online survey - Starbucks could launch a survey on their social media pages or the website and ask those who use the mobile pay solutions to tell them about their experience and if it has had a positive impact on customer service. They could also give a survey to their employees asking if they have noticed a difference in their interaction with customers who use the mobile pay compared to the others. Starbucks could ask the customer and employees to rate the difficulty of the transaction, the time of the transaction, and the overall attitude and connection between the worker and customer.
