Problem Set #5
Due: September 30 @ 11:59pm

Monday - 
#1: 
Observational Study - Using an observational study they could have someone observe consumers in the store as they check out with the mobile pay solutions at multiple locations. The observer would note the length of time the checkout took, rate the difficulty of transaction, and the overall attitude of the exchange between the customer and employee. They could then compare these observations with the experiences that consumers have who aren't using the mobile pay options to see which was better.
Focus Groups - Starbucks could hold a focus group with consumers who use the mobile pay solutions and ask them questions about their experience using the system compared to before when they used cash or card. They could also hold a focus group with employees and ask them questions about their interaction with customers who use mobile pay and if it has caused a positive impact on their work. From these group discussions Starbucks could figure out the impact the mobile pay solutions has had on both parties.
Online survey - Starbucks could launch a survey on their social media pages or the website and ask those who use the mobile pay solutions to tell them about their experience and if it has had a positive impact on customer service. They could also give a survey to their employees asking if they have noticed a difference in their interaction with customers who use the mobile pay compared to the others. Starbucks could ask the customer and employees to rate the difficulty of the transaction, the time of the transaction, and the overall attitude and connection between the worker and customer. 

Wednesday - (Jacob, Taylor, Marissa, Amy, Jack)
#2A: Does the content on a person's Facebook newsfeed affect a user's emotions?
#2B: Positive or negative content on a person's webpage
#2C: Emotions that result from using Facebook

#3A: 
- Survey because you can ask specific questions about certain aspects of the campaign and get people's response on them. An online survey could also be widely dispursed so you can get user's perceptions from many people from many different locations. 
#3B: 
- Observations can be used to observe people using your site and seeing how they choose to navigate the redesign. For best results, observe the user navigating the site before the redesign and compare it to their experience after the redesign. 
#3C:
- Simulations can be used to statistically model the hype of the next iPhone based off of the hype that has been generated by the past iPhone releases. This method of data collection will create an educated guess for the outcome of the iPhone but it would be supported by data. 

#4: 
Survey to determine user perceptions of a social media campaign: 
- Procedure: Create a short survey that won't take a lot of time to fill out and then widely disperse it on the social media platform that the campaign is running on.
- Questions and Analysis: The questions could relate to both the content of the campaign and the user's reaction to that campaign. First they should ask if the user even noticed the campaign and, if they did, what were their reaction to it. They could ask them what they remember about the campaign and if they believe it is a good one or not. These questions will mostly provide qualitative data that can be coded, merged, and then a content analysis can be performed to determine the users thoughts on the various aspects of the campaign. This data can then be used to either improve the current campaign or it will influence the future ones. 

Observations to assess the effectiveness of a web redesign:
- Procedure: Provide the user several tasks to complete using the website and have them talk out their process and any thoughts they have while doing them. Observe how they navigate the site, any positive or negative reactions they have when using it, and any additional questions or comments they have. Then make them perform the same procedure using the redesigned site and take the same observations. Finally, compare the two experiences and note any similarities or differences. 
- Questions and Analysis: There wouldn't be any direct questions that you would ask the user to answer because you will just be observing their actions. Through your observations you would most likely be collecting both qualitative and quantitative data on your observations. This observation data can be used to determine how the user's experience changed once the website was redesigned and they can identify any troubled areas of the site. They can then use this analysis to improve the site, therefore, improving the user's experience. 

Simulation to decide whether the next iPhone will live up to its hype (and turn a profit):
- Procedure: Compile information that relates to the hype and the success of the past iPhone releases. Then statistically model the data to determine what the hype and success will be like for the next iPhone release. 
- Questions and Analysis: There wouldn't be any direct questions that will have to be asked using simulation. The data collected will be both qualitative and quantitative. Rather, a lot of different statistical tests will be ran to analyze the data for any patterns or trends. This statistical testing will then give us an educated guess about what the outcome will be for the next iPhone release. 

#5:
You can fuse together mobile location data with data collected on people's text messaging, social media messenger apps, phone records, email records, mail/ shipping records, and data from any other forms of digital communication. This data can all be fused and then analyzed to see how a person's communication behaviors change based off of where they are located.
